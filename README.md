# Flowfield Generative Art
Flow field art, also known as vector field art, is algorithmically generated art popularized by Tyler Hobbs' Fidenza collection. He's done his own writeup of the method, link [here](https://tylerxhobbs.com/essays/2020/flow-fields), which is fanastic and definitely worth reading. I'm writing this to supplement that post with the added benefit of providing my code freely in a repository for anyone to use. 

This readme is structured in 4 parts. Part 1 is how to run a javascript code if you're unfamiliar with the code. Part 2 covers conceptually how flow field algorithms work and why they result in natural looking fluid fields. Part 3 covers creating vector field based art, and Part 4 covers creating code that works with [fx(hash)](fxhash.xyz), a popular NFT site on Tezos that functions by you uploading your own code and wrapping it in a token system provided by them so that users can mint from it directly and get a generative art piece that's 100% undetermined until after the mint.

## Part 1 - Running this code
This code was written in HTML and JavaScript.

To run the code, first download the index.html, p5.js, and sketch.js files into a single directory. Make sure you have internet access.

Then, open the index.html file in a browser by double clicking it or right clicking and selecting "open with" and then choose a browser. The code will run automatically, and display an image as the only thing on the webpage.
